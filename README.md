# ERPNext_Guides
A collection of user guides designed to help the 'newbie' user get past some of the hardest hurdles to starting up a ERPNext server. On occasion I might also add guides aimed at 'work-arounds' for some tasks that the main application might not handle as well as we would like. Everything I place here is free, open source, and covered by GPL3 license. 

Just select one of the folders named after a guide to see the detailed instructions and the sample files.

I hope you find it useful.
